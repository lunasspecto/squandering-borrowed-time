"Squandering borrowed time," an Inform game by Dominique Cyprès.

The game is still at a very very early stage of development and not ready for
release.

Included is a makefile created for compiling the project on the author's
system. It assumes the presence of the Inform compiler and library, and the
babel software suite, both available from the IF Archive at
http://www.ifarchive.org/  For the "source-dist" source distribution target,
it also assumes the presence of tar and the full version of p7zip.

The library extensions included, each of which has a .h extension, are written
by other authors and their authorship and license information are detailed
within. They are included in the source repository for convenience. They can
also be obtained from the IF Archive.
